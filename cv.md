## Projects

### [BattleCards](https://github.com/GamerCoder215/BattleCards)

*2023 - Present*

This is one of my favorite minecraft projects, partly because it introduced me to [Kotlin Development](http://kotlinlang.org/). The plugin support MC 1.8+ and allows you to summon "cards" to fight with and for you. Made in Kotlin with the [Spigot API](https://spigotmc.org), and inspired by the stands from [JoJo's Bizarre Adventure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JoJo%27s_Bizarre_Adventure).

This project was really fun and enjoyable to make because of how much I enjoy programming in the Kotlin language. Since Kotlin compiles to Java, it is nice to enjoy modern features of the programming language whilst still having support for older versions of Java and Minecraft. A big part in creating the "cards" was the use of JVM Annotations, reducing boilerplate and duplicated code, making it easy to make new ones as I maintain the project.

This project was also one of the first projects I actually sold on the official Spigot site and other plugin marketplaces, helping develop business and marketing skills.

### [PlasmaEnchants](https://github.com/Team-Inceptus/PlasmaEnchants)

*2023 - Present*

A very lightweight, simple, custom enchantments plugin for SpigotMC, and one of the first plugins I worked on to have [Kotlin Development](http://kotlinlang.org/). The plugin doesn't use any NMS at all, and uses modern spigot features from 1.14 and above. Designed in Kotlin with the [Spigot API](https://spigotmc.org).

This project was developed along BattleCards and was really fun to experiment with, design, market, and improve over its lifetime period. It taught me a lot about Kotlin, including extension functions, interoperability with Java, and many more aspects about the programming language.

### [SuperAdvancements](https://github.com/GamerCoder215/SuperAdvancements)

*2023 - Present*

This was a very interesting project due to the fact that I was motivated for it because existing Advancement APIs were lacking the features I needed. The framework allows you to create custom Minecraft Advancements, the default progression system in the game. Developed in Java with the [Spigot API](https://spigotmc.org), this heavily interops with [NMS (Net-Minecraft-Server)](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/general-introduction-of-packets-nms/), the undocumented and unsupported internals of the actual game.

This project taught me that it is easier to use the built-in way than recreating it from scratch because of how I thought about it beginning and ending the project.

### [StarCosmetics](https://github.com/GamerCoder215/StarCosmetics)

*2023 - Present*

One of my favorite Minecraft plugins to maintain and develop is one called StarCosmetics, a plugin which allows you to freely express yourself through a wide range of cosmetics available after completing certain tasks. Made in Java with the [Spigot API](https://spigotmc.org).

This project dove depth into one of the core features of OOP, **Abstraction**. Using Abstraction, I was able to reduce te amount of boilerplate and repetetiveness of adding hundreds of different cosmetics. I also used **Reflection** to help add multi-version support within the game itself.

### [MobChip](https://github.com/GamerCoder215/MobChip)

*2022 - Present*

Like a lot of my early projects, I started out by playing around, modding, and configuring video games. This one is a Minecraft API wrapper tool that makes it easy and simple to change the default AI, actions, schedules, data, and other aspects of any entity. Made in Java with the [Spigot API](https://spigotmc.org).

This project was really difficult and challenging to make because it dove into the undocumented and unexplored parts of the Spigot API and the abstract Minecraft code itself. Since most of the code is obfuscated, I had to use a lot of critical thinking and **Abstraction** to document my own code and make it easy and simple to use effectively.

### [Novaconomy](https://github.com/Team-Inceptus/Novaconomy)

*2021 - Present*

One of the best plugins I have ever continued to develop is this one. It started out as a small project that was intended as a one-and-done, but I eventually decided to keep adding more features and did NOT regret it.

This project taught me many things, from learning SQL statements in the JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) API to how to use Data and Byte streams for storing data in text and files. It also taught me about intercepting [Packets](https://wiki.vg/Protocol), the base protocol Minecraft uses to send and receive information between users, which is used by [Netty Channels](https://netty.io/4.1/api/io/netty/channel/Channel.html), creating some background in those APIs. Made in Java with the [Spigot API](https://spigotmc.org), featuring player-owned Markets and Corporation, creatable and customizable Economies, SQL Support in MySQL, SQLite, and PostrgreSQL, and so many more future features. 

### [QuantumPen](https://github.com/GamerCoder215/QuantumPen)

*2022*

This was the first plugin that I listed, that is sill freely available to download on my [SpigotMC Plugin Resources](https://www.spigotmc.org/members/gamercoder215.1229877/#resources). It allows you to manually modify and send Packets to players, fabricating different server events for educational, fun, and adniminstrator-related purposes. 

Built in Java with the [Spigot API](https://spigotmc.org) and NMS for MC 1.18.2, this is the first project of many.

### [SMPCore](https://github.com/Team-Inceptus/SMPCore) / [NoobySMP](https://github.com/Team-Inceptus/NoobySMP)

*2021 - 2022*

Before disbanding TheNoobyGods, we also ran a Minecraft SMP (Survival Minecraft Server), and these are the main 2 server JARs that I personally developed. Both interact with NMS heavily and use many parts of the [Spigot API](https://spigotmc.org) for key features.

This plugin holds a close heart to me mostly because of how few the second version lasted, and how much I wanted to change the first one. One of the plugins had helped me develop some of the popular ones I currently develop and maintain.

### [super-dictionary](https://github.com/gamerCoder215/super-dictionary)

*2021*

A small project around a Dictionary API that I found. It's a simple asynchronously-based dictionary API.

### [nodejs-notebook](https://github.com/brightplum/nodejs-notebook)

*2021*

My first NPM Package published in 2021. A JavaScript wrapper around editing specific code files, useful for changing code at runtime using JS. A simple project that helped teach me how to document properly. Still downloaded a little bit today, even though it is long abandoned.

### [NoobyGods (NoobyBot)](https://github.com/Team-Inceptus/NoobyGods)

*2020 - 2022*

Despite what the repository may say otherwise, this was one of my first JavaScript Discord Bot projects ever that I hosted on the free hosting site [repl.it](https://replit.com). This Discord Bot was a personal bot for a [HypixelMC](https://hypixel.net) Guild called "TheNoobyGods," which I ran before founding Team Inceptus.

Started from small commands, it taught me how to interact with the [Discord API](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro), keeping up with continued evolutions since 2020. It also showed me how to use [mineflayer](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer), a JS Framework that allowed you to remotely control an in-game Minecraft Account with code.

## Interests

I enjoy modding and playing around with the source code of various games (that's how I got into software engineering), so I'm a very big gamer. I also enjoy running a lot and sometimes play various sports such as soccer and tennis.
