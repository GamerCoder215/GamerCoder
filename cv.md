## Projects

### [BattleCards](https://github.com/GamerCoder215/BattleCards)
*2023 - Present*

This is one of my favorite minecraft projects, partly because it introduced me to [Kotlin Development](http://kotlinlang.org/). The plugin support MC 1.8+ and allows you to summon "cards" to fight with and for you. Made in Kotlin with the [Spigot API](https://spigotmc.org), and inspired by the stands from [JoJo's Bizarre Adventure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JoJo%27s_Bizarre_Adventure).

This project was really fun and enjoyable to make because of how much I enjoy programming in the Kotlin language. Since Kotlin compiles to Java, it is nice to enjoy modern features of the programming language whilst still having support for older versions of Java and Minecraft. A big part in creating the "cards" was the use of JVM Annotations, reducing boilerplate and duplicated code, making it easy to make new ones as I maintain the project.

This project was also one of the first projects I actually sold on the official Spigot site and other plugin marketplaces, helping develop business and marketing skills.

### [StarCosmetics](https://github.com/GamerCoder215/StarCosmetics)
*2023 - Present*

One of my favorite Minecraft plugins to maintain and develop is one called StarCosmetics, a plugin which allows you to freely express yourself through a wide range of cosmetics available after completing certain tasks. Made in Java with the [Spigot API](https://spigotmc.org).

This project dove depth into one of the core features of OOP, **Abstraction**. Using Abstraction, I was able to reduce te amount of boilerplate and repetetiveness of adding hundreds of different cosmetics. I also used **Reflection** to help add multi-version support within the game itself.

### [MobChip](https://github.com/GamerCoder215/MobChip)
*2022 - Present*

Like a lot of my early projects, I started out by playing around, modding, and configuring video games. This one is a Minecraft API wrapper tool that makes it easy and simple to change the default AI, actions, schedules, data, and other aspects of any entity. Made in Java with the [Spigot API](https://spigotmc.org).

This project was really difficult and challenging to make because it dove into the undocumented and unexplored parts of the Spigot API and the abstract Minecraft code itself. Since most of the code is obfuscated, I had to use a lot of critical thinking and **Abstraction** to document my own code and make it easy and simple to use effectively.

### [Novaconomy](https://github.com/Team-Inceptus/Novaconomy)

*2021 - Present*

One of the best plugins I have ever continued to develop is this one. It started out as a small project that was intended as a one-and-done, but I eventually decided to keep adding more features and did NOT regret it.

This project taught me many things, from learning SQL statements in the JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) API to how to use Data and Byte streams for storing data in text and files. It also taught me about intercepting [Packets](https://wiki.vg/Protocol), the base protocol Minecraft uses to send and receive information between users, which is used by [Netty Channels](https://netty.io/4.1/api/io/netty/channel/Channel.html), creating some background in those APIs. Made in Java with the [Spigot API](https://spigotmc.org), featuring player-owned Markets and Corporation, creatable and customizable Economies, SQL Support in MySQL, SQLite, and PostrgreSQL, and so many more future features.
