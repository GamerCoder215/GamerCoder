# About GamerCoder

I illustrate my passion for video games, computers, and software as a whole through the development, modification, and release of various platforms and projects that engage my users in a fun and proactice way.

As the founder of [Team Inceptus](https://teaminceptus.us), my team and I continue to bring joy through the development of modifications and game platforms through our own individual and monetary-free time. We do ask for donations, although it is not required to join our work.

My first programming experience began in 2019 when I developed my first discord bot for servers that I privately managed. Falling in love with programming, and having experience in various block editors like [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu), it foreshadowed a long, prosperous, and active path of software development for me at the age of 12. I currently work on Minecraft plugins and modifications, while also having some other projects such as [Terminal Miner](https://github.com/GamerCoder215/Terminal-Miner), the first game I ever made in C++.
