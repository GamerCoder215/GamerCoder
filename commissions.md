## Important Notice

<details>
    <summary>Click to Read More</summary>

As a current student, I do not have the legal capabilities of creating or signing for any contract or contract-related work. Please commission me at your own risk.

The following policies written on this page are ones I have written myself and will oblige by through the commissioning process. Please read them throroughly and communicate your compliance as soon as possible.
</details>

## Prerequisites

Firstly, please check the above status symbol to see if I am currently open to commissions. If I am unavailable, it is usually because I have too many commissions going on currently or am busy with other things. If you contact me while I am unavailable, I can put you on a waitlist for commissions, but do not expect major progress anytime soon.

I highly recommend you view my [cv](/cv) and [demos](/demos) before contacting me for a commission to ensure I am qualified and capable of doing what you ask. This is to ensure that I have the knowledge and capabilities of completing your task at a specific level. Please also communicate your priorities as clearly as possible for an accurate quote.

I will **automatically deny** commissions with the following themes:

- Pornographic or NSFW Content
- Racist, Homophobic, Sexist, Bigoted or anti-LGBTQ+ content
  - Includes other discriminatory themes and content
- Personal Attacks, Harms or Slander
- Malware, Spyware, Phishing or Virus-related code
- Illegal or Unlawful themes that violate US Federal Law or UN International Law

## Pricing

Developers are notorious for severely overcharging or undercharging their clients, so all flat prices will be open for negotation.

I offer a free 30-day period after the planned deadline for **only** bug fixes discovered later. If you need extended support, please view the prices below:

- (Optional) $20 / Year for Extra Bug Support
- (Optional) $35 / Year for Minor Feature Additions
  - Extra Bug Support AND Minor Feature Additions Combined Price: $50 / Year 
  - Both are Capped at 2 Years

These are **not** able to be refunded and are **not** open for negotation and will not change.

If the commissioned plugin plans to integrate with a system like Tebex to produce profit, I may offer or include a small monthly commission percentage of the profit as a royalty fee in the quote in exchange for a lower flat price.  

## Refund Policy

The following will apply upon a refund request:

- I will **only** offer **full** or **close to full** refunds if the plugin is not classified as "half done" or "50% done." What is "half done" means that the current request refund date is past the halfway mark between the **discussed deadline** and **the day you have paid the upfront cost**.
  - If you have paid for an extended period, I will offer these until the deadline has passed.
- After a project is "50% done," a refund policy will be negotated upon request. The maximum refund amount I will grant is **75%**, however this heavily depends on the refund request date.
- Please keep in mind that I make an effort to communicate progress and test with the client as much as possible to ensure features are made to your satisfaction. There should not be any major surprises upon release.
- After the deadline has passed, **I will not offer any refunds.** If you need bugs fixed or minor features added, please pay the fees shown above.

There are special cases where I will offer a full refund, such as if I am unable to complete the project due to personal or business reasons. These will be discussed forehand.

## Contact
