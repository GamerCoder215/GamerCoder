As a current student, I do not have the legal capabilities of signing for any contract or contract-related work. Please commission me at your own risk.

## Before you Commission Me

Firstly, please check the above status symbol to see if I am currently open to commissions. If I am unavailable, it is usually because I have too many commissions going on currently or am busy with other things. If you contact me while I am unavailable, I can put you on a waitlist for commissions, but do not expect major progress anytime soon.

I highly recommend you view my [cv](/cv) and [demos](/demos) before contacting me for a commission to ensure I am qualified and capable of doing what you ask. This is to ensure that I have the knowledge and capabilities of completing your task at a specific 

## Commision Prerequisites

I will **automatically deny** commissions with the following themes:

- Pornographic or NSFW Content
- Racist, Homophobic, Sexist, Bigoted or anti-LGBTQ+ content
  - Includes other discriminatory themes and content

I typically charge a **20% upfront** charge on all commissions. I do this because I am unable to sign a contract (see *important notice*) and would like to confirm that there is a commitment present between both of us. Basically, it's big enough so I don't get scammed and small enough so you don't get scammed.

If you are unhappy with my work and request a refund, <u>I will only offer <strong>full</strong> or <strong>close to full</strong> refunds before a project is classified as 50% done.</u> What is "50% done" or "half done" depends on the complexity, effort, and time put into a project, which is very subjective and can be discussed. After that period, a refund policy will be negotated revolving around how much has been completed.

## Price Negotations

I am willing to negotiate prices to a (reasonable) amount. Developers are notorious for undercharging or overcharging clients, so it is important to me for your well-being and satisfaction.

It is also important that you communicate <u>priorities</u> and <u>budget</u> as much as possible **BEFORE** I quote you to ensure that a fair price    is set. By "priorities," I am referring to what I should be looking for over one another (i.e. performance, efficiency, maintainability, quality, etc). The more effort, quality, efficiency, and/or performance requested, the more likely I am to have a more expensive quote.

Unless your project or plugin integrates with a system like Tebex to sell a product for real money, the quote will not include a commission rate. My minimum commission rate percentage is **4%**, and this will increase depending on the complexity of the products I am commissioned to sell.
